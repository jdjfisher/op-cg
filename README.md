# OP-CG

`op-cg` was a tool produced during my undergraduate dissertation. The tool served to demonstrate a MVP for the next iteration of the `OP2` source-to-source translator. Following the completion of my dissertation, this repository is now archived and any further work continues in the core [OP2 repository](https://github.com/OP-DSL/OP2-Common).
